You start with the input number -12345, which is negative.
After sorting the string, you might have something like -54321, which is still negative.
So, the result should be a negative number when the input is negative. The -(-54321) operation in the code correctly maintains the negative sign, resulting in -54321, which is the expected behavior. The sign of the number is not changed to positive at any point in the code.
